# Marketing Agency

HTML, CSS and Github

# Description

In this project I was asked to refactor an existing marketing site to make it more accessible.

# Brief Summary:

I Amended the nav bar so that once selected it should direct to the corresponding section of the page.
I Added alt attributes to the images.
The Elements follow a logical structure and sequential order.

# Marketing Agency

HTML, CSS and Github

# Description

In this project I refactored an existing site to make it more accessible.

# Brief Summary:

Amended the nav bar so that once selected it should direct to the corresponding section of the page.
Added alt attributes to the images.
Elements follow a logical structure and sequential order.
